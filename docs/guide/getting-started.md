# Getting Started

There are several ways to get started with Morpheme UI:

- Via Morpheme CLI (recommended)
- Via Online Playground
- Manual Setup

## Via Morpheme CLI

The fastest way to get started with Morpheme UI is through our Morpheme CLI called `create-morpheme-app`. With this CLI, you create your project quickly with pre-made templates and even choose which module to add to your project.

To get started with Morpheme CLI, run this command in the terminal:

```
npx create-morpheme-app@latest
```

![](/create-morpheme-app.png)

Then, choose your prefered starter template or choose `Custom` to customize the module you want to add.

## Online Playground

You can also try the online playground on Stackblitz.
