# Quick Start

GITS UI is now **Morpheme UI**. Check out migration guide [here](/guide/migration).
:::

There are several ways to get started with Morpheme UI:

- Via Morpheme CLI (recommended)
- Via Online Playground
- Manual Setup

## Try It Online

You can try Morpheme UI directly in your browser on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/gitsindonesia/ui-component/tree/main/starter/nuxt-minimal).

## Via Morpheme CLI

The fastest way to get started with Morpheme UI is through our [Morpheme CLI](/tools/cli) called `create-morpheme-app`. With this CLI, you create your project quickly with pre-made templates and even choose which module to add to your project.

To get started with Morpheme CLI, run this command in the terminal:

::: code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpx create-morpheme-app@latest
```

```bash [npm]
npx create-morpheme-app@latest
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create morpheme-app@latest
```

```bash [bun]
bunx create-morpheme-app@latest
```
