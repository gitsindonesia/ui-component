# kitchen-sink

This is a minimal app created by running `npx create-morpheme-app`. This project uses the following technologies for a great developer and user-experience:

- [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Morpheme UI](https://gitsindonesia.github.io/ui-component/)

## How to get going?

This is a straight-forward setup with minimal templating and scaffolding. The options you selected during the sidebase CLI setup are all here though. Good places to continue reading are:
- [the First Steps documentation](https://gitsindonesia.github.io/ui-component/)

Some tasks you should probably do in the beginning are:
- [ ] replace this generic README with a more specific one
- [ ] install the Vue Volar extension
- [ ] enable [Volar takeover mode](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation#prerequisites) to ensure a smooth editor setup
